UPGRADING

If you are upgrading from a previous version, be sure to check out the
Changes file for 'TEMPLATE CHANGES' notices. If you have customized
templates that have changed, you may need to make minor adjustments
to them for compatibility. The author makes every effort to make only
forward-compatible changes (i.e., changes that do not add new template
variables) to existing templates.
